## Test

This is some test post to ensure that things are working as they _should_.

```rs
fn getGreeting(name: &str) -> String {
    format!("Hello there, {}!", name);
}

fn main() {
    let name = "Josh";
    println!("{}", getGreeting(&name));
}
```

## Another Test

This is a paragraph with some math in it: $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$.

And this is a block:

$$
f(x) = x^2
$$

And these are some basic Markdown elements:

- This is a list
- This element is **bold**
- This element is _italic_
- This element is `code`
- This element is ~~strikethrough~~
- This element is a [link](https://google.com)
